<p class="info">Recent warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicate that surpassing critical temperature thresholds could trigger irreversible tipping points, including collapsing ice sheets, failing agricultural regions, and large-scale displacement that overwhelms global infrastructure. Simultaneously, leading researchers and institutions such as the United Nations have cautioned that unregulated artificial intelligence could enable autonomous weapons, destabilize financial systems, and amplify misinformation at a scale capable of eroding societal trust. The ongoing conflict involving Russia and Ukraine has underscored how rapidly regional wars can escalate among nuclear-armed powers, raising the specter of miscalculation with consequences that would extend far beyond national borders. Intensifying political polarization and weakening democratic norms across multiple states further diminish the likelihood of coordinated global action, increasing the probability that environmental, technological, and military crises could converge into a systemic global collapse.</p>
